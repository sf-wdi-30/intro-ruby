| Apply Ruby control flow to create command line applications |

## Framing for the Week

As we learn Ruby, it's important to revisit how we learned our first language and use that to organize the study of our new language. Learning our second programming language is a process of translating concepts, expressions, and patterns from our familiar language into our new language. Learning our first language involved more identification and comprehension of the knowledge required to implement our first programs. We should begin by organizing this knowledge to build a better understanding as we transition to Ruby.

## Types of Knowledge

* **Declarative Knowledge** > your "what is" knowledge, i.e. describing what something is
* **Imperative knowledge** > your "how to" knowledge, i.e. describing how to do something

## Parts of A Language

* `Primitives`
* `Combinations`
* `Abstractions`

## Discussion Questions

* What is JavaScript? What does it look like?
* What are some of the primitives in JavaScript?
  * Think data types, variable declarations, conditionals, functions, etc.
* How did we use JavaScript to build things? How did we build up from the fundamentals of the language?
* What could possibly be different in another language? How could we change the syntax, but keep the semantics?

## Challenges

*Options for running these challenges:*

1. Use `irb` in your terminal.

1. Create a `.rb` file. Put your code there and run with `ruby YOUR_FILE_NAME.rb`.

### Data Types

1. Store your `first_name` in a variable and your `last_name` in another variable.

2. Concatenate your `first_name` and `last_name` variables, and store the output in a new variable called `full_name`.

3. Use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-split" target="_blank">`.split`</a> to turn your `full_name` variable into an array.

### Loops

1. Print (`puts`) "Ruby is awesome!" 50 times. Implement this 3 different ways, using:
  * <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm" target="_blank">`while`</a>
  * <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm" target="_blank">`for`</a>
  * <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Integer.html#method-i-times" target="_blank">`.times`</a>

2. Save any string to a variable, then create an empty hash called count (`count = {}`). Loop through the string, and count occurrences of each letter. Store the counts in your hash like this example:
  * For the string `apple`, your `count` hash would look like this: `{a: 1, p: 2, l: 1, e: 1}`.

3. Write a program that gets user input from the terminal and `puts` it until the input is the word `"quit"` or `"q"`.
  * **Hint:** Use `gets.chomp` instead of `gets` to remove trailing `\n`.

4. Write a program that prints the "bottles of beer on the wall" song:

  ```
  5 bottles of beer on the wall,
  5 bottles of beer!
  Take one down and pass it around,
  4 bottles of beer on the wall!
  ...
  ```

  * Use `gets.chomp` to ask the user how many verses they want to hear.
  * Make sure your song prints "1 **bottle** of beer".
  * When the song gets to "0 bottles of beer on the wall", it should print "No more bottles of beer on the wall" instead.

## Stretch Challenges

### Iterators: Each

1. Define an array of 4 phrases: `"Hello, world"`, `"OMG"`, `"Ruby"`, and `"Pair Programming"`. Use <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_iterators.htm" target="_blank">`.each`</a> to iterate over the array and `puts` each phrase.

2. Iterate over your array of phrases again, but this time, only `puts` the phrase if its length is 5 letters or longer. Otherwise, print a message that the phrase is too short, and include the phrase's index in the message (**Hint:** Look up `.each_with_index`).

### Iterators: Map

1. Write a program that <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-map" target="_blank">maps</a> an array of numbers to double each number.

2. Write a program that maps an array of words to the reverse of each word. (**Hint:** Look up `.reverse`)

### More Stretch Challenges

1. Create a simple temperature convertor. It should function like the example below:

  ```
  Type '1' to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or '2' to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius
  1
  Enter Celsius temperature:
  24
  24 degrees Celsius is equal to 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit
  ```

2. Create a simple calculator that first asks the user what method they would like to use (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), then asks the user for two numbers, printing the result of the method with the two numbers. Here is a sample prompt:

  ```
  What calculation would you like to do? (add, sub, mult, div)
  add
  What is the first number?
  3
  What is the second number?
  6
  The result is 9
  ```
